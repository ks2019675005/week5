vi Commands

vi commands are used in "screen" mode (the default), where you use the commands to move around the screen and to per-from operations on the text.

Most vi commands follow a genderal pattern:
    [commamd][numdber]textobject
or the equivakent from:
    [number][command]textobject


Movement Commands
vi movement commands distinguish between two kinds of "words." The lowercase commands define a word as a conting-uous sequence of underscores, letters, and digits. The upper-case commands define a word as a contigous sequence ofnonwhitespace characters.
